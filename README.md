===============

Welcome to the Thaumic Infusion Repo, first of this mod IS open-source. Feel free to take, re-produce, build and do anything with it as you wish, I only ask that you leave a note that the code orginiated from this repo.

About This Mod
--------------

Thaumic Infusion (TI) is a magical mod, all about adding in a whole new mechanic into minecraft. It expands upon the idea of infusion, that was explained in Thaumcraft and brings reality to it. For it says in the thaumonomicon, that upon infusing a feather into a block, that block would become as light. TI aims to deliver just that, but instead of items it works with aspects and essentially allows you to take any aspect, then infuse it into a block. Each aspect has it's own personal effect, these effects can just change a single property about the block or add in a complete other mechanic into it.

So, an example of this would be: If you were to infuse the aspect Lux into a block, the said block would then emit light when placed in the world. If you infuse Aqua, said block would then become a tank. The list of all the effects go on.

Localizing
--------------

So for those who are intrested in lending a helping hand to the development of my mod and want to make it more accsible to those whom do not speak english, then you can help localize it to other languages.

To do this, just fork this repo and then use the [EN_US.lang](https://github.com/TheDrunkMafia/ThaumicInfusion/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/thaumicinfusion/lang/en_US.lang)  file as a basis of the localizations, then simply make a push request.
